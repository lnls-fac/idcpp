# --- Summary ---
#
# This is the input file for generate_kickmap script.
# This script reads fieldmaps (one for each y-plane) from a magnet model and calculates
# the magnet kickmap. Cubic spline is used for interpolation of the magnetic field.
# A Runge-kutta algorithm is used for the integration of the equations of motion.
