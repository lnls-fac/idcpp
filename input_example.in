# ==========================

# --- Summary ---
#
# This is the input file for lnls-generate-kickmap script.
# This script reads fieldmaps (one for each y-plane) from a magnet model and calculates
# the magnet kickmap. Cubic spline is used for interpolation of the magnetic field.
# A Runge-Kutta algorithm is used for the integration of the equations of motion.

# --- Input and Output files ---

# Number of fieldmap files:
1

# Name of the fieldmap files:
fieldmap.txt

# Name of the kickmap output file:
kickmap.txt
